I‚Äôm hesitant to give up income or pause real estate growth, so part-time seemed like the path‚Ä¶ until I started getting FOMO seeing how many big jumps happen because of the full-time route.\\n\\nExtra Context:\\n\\nMy current firm has a 2 to 3 year promotion cycle\\n\\nMy current role likely caps around $150K, and I‚Äôll probably stay stuck there unless I get promoted\\n\\nI already hold a technical MSBA, so I‚Äôm not sure how much incremental value an MBA adds vs. overlaps\\n\\nI‚Äôve been scaling in real estate, and I‚Äôm cautious about MBA debt affecting my DTI and mortgage eligibility\\n\\nMy sibling runs a commercial real estate business, and I benefited from early advice and feedback that helped me land wins\\nMy parents are planning to gift ~$500K over the next 2 years, so while I have some financial cushion, I‚Äôm trying to be smart and not tie myself up with debt or a bad ROI decision\\n\\nI come from an Asian family, everyone‚Äôs in business, and to be honest, my parents and sibling (ironically, my sibling got mba from no name state school long time ago, my parents is oversea, also got their college degree education, which is extremely rare at their time in their third world country) over tend to look down on people who over educate themselves (MBAs, grad school, etc.). In their eyes, if you study too much and don‚Äôt succeed, you‚Äôre just wasting time. So if I do pursue this, I have to make it worth it or I‚Äôll never hear the end of it\\n\\nWhat I‚Äôm Wrestling With:\\n\\n‚úÖ Am I limiting my upside by sticking to part-time?\\n\\n‚úÖ Would a full-time MBA, despite the opportunity cost, open strategic doors that part-time just can‚Äôt , especially for a pivot?\\n\\n‚úÖ Is it better to keep stacking assets and use a part-time MBA to boost credibility and promotion odds, even if it‚Äôs not a career reset?\\n\\n‚úÖ Does school brand still carry weight if you go part-time?\\n\\n\\nAnyone here successfully pivoted from part-time to Big 4 Strategy or T2? Would love to hear how you approached it.\\n\\n\\nBrutal honesty welcomed. Appreciate any insight.'},\n",

Another shows that they are flexible for working professionals. A third one focuses on finance specialisation. Suddenly, you pause and wonder:\\n\\n**‚ÄúWhat are the top private MBA colleges in India?‚Äù**\\n\\nAnd more importantly, which type of MBA should you opt for?\\xa0\\n\\nYou are not alone at that moment of decision-making. Let us break it down and explore the options.\\xa0\\n\\n# Why It Matters: Choosing the Right Type of MBA\\n\\nAn MBA is more than a degree ‚Äî it is nothing but a turning point. If you wish to climb the corporate ladder, switch industries, and become an entrepreneur, your MBA needs to fit the journey. And when residing in a country like India, where private business schools are rapidly changing, selecting the right type of MBA is just as important as choosing the right college.\\xa0\\n\\nSo, before asking: ‚Äú[**What are the top private MBA colleges in India**](https://srmuniversity.ac.in/blog/best-private-mba-colleges-in-india/)**?**‚Äù ask yourself: What type of MBA do I need?\\xa0\\n\\n# Full-Time MBA: For Career Starters and Switchers\\n\\nThe traditional two-year, full-time MBA is designed for those who wish to complete immersion. It combines classroom learning, peer networking, internships and career placements.\\n\\nThis format is perfect if you are a fresh graduate and looking to make a complete shift in your career path. Most of the top private MBA colleges in India offer this as their flagship program because of the structured approach and proven results.\\xa0\\n\\n# Executive MBA: For the Working Professional\\n\\nAlready working but eyeing a leadership role? An executive MBA (EMBA) is the best choice. It is designed for professionals who have 2-10 years of experience. EMBA programs are usually designed on weekends and in hybrid formats.\\xa0\\n\\nSome of the top private MBA colleges in India have adapted their executive MBAs to match the industry demands, which are fast-paced, practical and convenient.\\xa0\\n\\n# Online, Hybrid & Global MBAs: For the Flexible Learner\\n\\nNew-age learners need new-age formats. Enter online, hybrid and global MBAs.\\n\\n* Online MBAs bring recorded lectures and virtual classrooms to the screen\\n* Hybrid MBAs combine online learning with offline residencies and projects\\n* Global MBAs offer international modules and cross-border exposure.\\xa0\\n\\nWhen searching for ‚Äú[**what are the top private MBA colleges in India**](https://srmuniversity.ac.in/blog/best-private-mba-colleges-in-india/)**?**‚Äù, you should notice how many have embraced these formats in recent years.\\n\\n# Specialised MBAs: For Focused Career Goals\\n\\nEager to know about what you love already? Specialised MBAs in areas like finance, marketing, HR, business analytics and even healthcare or sustainability are becoming increasingly popular.\\xa0\\n\\nInstead of a generalist approach, you can go deep from the very first day. It is a great fit if you are clear about your interests. Many top private MBA colleges in India offer this flexibility, sometimes even helping you to pivot after the very first year.\\xa0\\n\\n# Where should students apply?\\n\\nIf you are exploring MBA programmes that combine academic rigour, industry alignment, and modern delivery, **SRM University Delhi-NCR, Sonepat** deserves your attention.\\xa0\\n\\nThis emerging private university is redefining what it means to opt for an MBA in India - with programmes made for real-world success.\\xa0\\n\\nHere is what makes **SRM University Delhi-NCR, Sonepat** noticeable:\\n\\n* It is important to select from full-time MBAs and specialized tracks in finance, marketing, HR, business analytics, and others. They are crafted to match the current industry trends.\\xa0\\n* Internships, case studies, business simulations, and leadership labs make sure that you are not just learning theory but also applying it.\\xa0\\n* With global collaborations and visiting faculty from abroad, students can get exposure beyond the borders.\\n* **SRM University Delhi-NCR, Sonepat** focuses on preparing students for leadership roles from the very first day. This is in the form of skill-building workshops and strong recruiter connections.\\n\\nIf you are looking for an MBA experience that goes beyond the classroom and prepares you for a dynamic career landscape, **SRM University Delhi-NCR, Sonepat** should be at the top of your list.\\xa0\\n\\n# Final Thought: Choose What Fits You\\n\\nYour MBA is a personal journey.

But every day felt like disengagement from life.\\n\\nI ended up quitting and starting my own edtech company, Tahiliani Classes Pvt Ltd.\\n\\nIt was a real challenge as I bootstrapped the company and had to build everything from scratch starting with having over 1500 videos created.\\n\\nTo market the company, I ran various marketing campaigns. Something that literally no one does for themselves is to set up a physical center in a place they don‚Äôt know anyone, let alone hire people. But to me, as someone who wanted to bootstrap, I was left with no option.\\n\\nThe price I had to pay for being that stubborn was to burn out.\\n\\nAt my peak, I was working 19 hours a day, waking up at 3 AM, and sleeping well after 10 PM.\\n\\nThis is what my days looked like:\\n\\nI gave myself 3:30 AM to 6:30 AM to study and make notes,\\n\\n7:00 AM to 10:00 AM was reserved for taking classes,\\n\\n10:00 AM to 1:00 PM was reserved for planning campaigns and collaborations,\\n\\n1:00 PM to 3:00 PM lunch was having this alongside studying,\\n\\n3:00 PM to 9:30 PM take classes,\\n\\nFinally 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM review the campaigns.\\n\\nThere are no weekends, no parties, no breaks.\\n\\nOnly my ideal future and the drive needed to chase it down.\\n\\nIt expanded‚Ä¶ and then it stopped.\\n\\nIt all came to a halt after two years of efforts, making the business unsustainable.\\n\\nWe had to stop and it was painful. Not only did I lose money, but I also ran out of answers and energy, everything literally just died.‚Äù\\n\\nMy existence started with an inward sense of losing everything,\\n\\nThe Relationships fell apart as I began to withdraw while watching my life go up in flames.\\n\\nAll my self assurance Came crashing down.\\n\\nIt felt as though I was in a barely afloat ship, while water continued to seep in: Struggling. Helpless.\\n\\nAnd once that happened, it marked the beginning of my true struggles:\\n\\nFighting with myself, Against depression. Anxiety. Pride. Silence.\\n\\nSilently judged by my family.\\n\\nUnwanted opinions that I never asked for.\\n\\nWaves of friends who never truly cared drifting away.\\n\\nAs the sole breadwinner of the family, there was no escape and time to think and reflect.\\n\\nEverything went haywire as my life savings took a massive hit, along with our hopeful plans and dreams.\\n\\nIn a desperate attempt to bounce back, the first offer to come my way was Teaching Physics for IIT-JEE aspirants.\\n\\nIn a bid to keep pushing forward, I launched my own Youtube channel named ‚ÄòThe Layman Way‚Äô to share knowledge as a means of saving myself.\\n\\nNoticing I lacked the fundamental understanding of ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô, I knew it was time to change that.\\n\\nIn life, sometimes you need to make sacrifices to turn things around for the better. So, I enrolled myself into IIM Kozhikode's Executive MBA program whilst juggling a full time job.\\n\\nNot as fun as it sounds. Not as relaxing as it seems. Just as grueling.\\n\\nI‚Äôve experienced worse, and I know what burnout feels like when it completely dismantles you.\\n\\nThere are still days when I feel like I have let myself down.\\n\\nBut now I understand something deeper: Failure isn‚Äôt the end. Quitting is.\\n\\nIf you have ever :\\n\\n1. Failed at something you cared about.\\n2. Been burried under self-doubt\\n3. Thought it was too late to begin again\\n\\nPlease know you are not alone .
